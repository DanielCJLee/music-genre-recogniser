# Music Genre Recogniser
This is a simplified implementation of "Musical Genre Classification of Audio Signals", found in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING, VOL. 10, NO. 5, JULY 2002, by George Tzanetakis and Perry Cook. It is in the form of an Android app but is as of yet a work in progress. The main task performed by the code is to extract some custom features from an audio signal, detailed in the above paper, which can then be classified using standard machine learning techniques. The features are in two categories: musical surface features, which describe spectral information taken over very short time periods, and beat detection features, which are taken over longer time periods and provide a means to model rhythm. The code uses a thread pool executor to do the processing in parallel.
